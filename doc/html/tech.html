	      it has a specialized function. At this place I don't what to go into details with program does what.

NAME="CYRUS">2.2. Cyrus IMAP</H2
><P
>The Cyrus IMAP is developed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University.</P
><P
>Unlike the WU-IMAPd Cyrus is using its own method to store the users mail. The data is stored 
	in a own method. Each message is stored in its own file. The benefit of separate file is also 
	the reliability, on filesystem errors, only one message is lost. Metadata like statuts of a message (seen etc)
	is stored in a database. Additionally the messages are indexed. This makes Cyrus very performant. 
	Especially with lots of users and/or lot of big emails, 
	there is nothing else fast as the Cyrus IMAP-server.</P
><P
>	Another very important feature is, you don't need a local Un*x user for each account. All users are 
	authenticated by the IMAP-Server. This makes it a great solution for really huge base of users.</P
><P
>	User administration is done by special IMAP-commands. This allows you to either use the commandline interface, 
	or use one of the available Webinterfaces. This Method is much more secure than a Webinterface to
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
> /etc/passwd</TT
>.</P
><P
>Starting from Cyrus 2.1, the SASL-lib version 2 is used for authentication. 
	For the setup described in this HOWTO, there is a tree-layer authentication implemented. Cyrus 
	authenticates with saslauthdaemon which forwards the request
	to pam_mysql which finally looks up the MySQL-table.</P
><P
>	Since CMU changed the license policy for Cyrus, this software is going to be used by much more users.</P

NAME="SASL">2.3. Cyrus SASL</H2
><P
>SASL means »Simple Authentication and Security Layer«. It is standardized by the IETF (Internet 
	Engineering Taskforce). SASL is used by network servers (Here for Cyrus-IMAP) to
	handle authentication requests from clients.</P
><P
>Cyrus SASL is a extensive software, and sometimes not
	easy to understand. Even I just have a minimum knowledge needed to write this HOWTO.</P

NAME="OPENSSL">2.4. OpenSSL</H2
><P
>OpenSSL is a library needed by SASL for encrytion of the data-stream. It is used by 
	by almost all opensource software which needs encryption methods. Most or all distributions comes with
	a preinstalled OpenSSL. Be sure to install also the appropriate devel-package. If you like, you also can 
	compile OpenSSL by your self. This is especially recommended, if you need to fix a security hole.

NAME="MYSQL">2.5. MySQL Database</H2
><P
>MySQL is a very fast, powerful and very nice to handle Database.</P
><P
>Since Cyrus can authenticate its users with pam, you can use pam_mysql as a connector to the
	userdatebase stored in MySQL. This allows you to create a nice Webinterface for your users for changing 
	passwords, define and delete aliases and more.</P

NAME="PAM-MYSQL">2.6. pam_mysql</H2
><P
>pam means "Pluggable Authentication module" and was originally proposed by some people at Sun.
	In meantime a lot of modules have been developed. One of them is an interface to MySQL</P
><P
>With pam_mysql you store the users password in a mysql database. Further, Postfix is able to
	lookup aliases from a MySQL-table. At the end of the day, you have a base for all administrative tasks
	to be done by the postmaster.</P
><P
>You will be able to delegate some tasks to Powerusers, e.g. creating accounts for a particular
	domain. Changing passwords and creating new aliases can be delegated to the user. At the end of the day 
	you as a Sysadmin have the time to do some more productive tasks, or write a HOWTO for the Linux 
	Documentation Project.</P
