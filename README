This is version 0.5.4-rc1

This software is intended to be used by system adminitrators to provide them
with a friendly Web-interface instead of the commandline cyradm.

A goal for the future is to incorporate authentication with makes it possible,
that normal mail-users can change what they are authorized to change. This can 
lead in lower workload for the System Administrator and higher flexibiliy for the
mailuser.

This is a pre-Version 1.0 and only for users that are knowing what they are doing.

Especially there is no input validation yet, 
i.e. its possible to add a email-adress like f*o*o+b*a*r@domain.org, very bad.

Feedback to luc at delouw.ch is appreciated.
